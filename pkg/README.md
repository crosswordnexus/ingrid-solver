# Ingrid Core

This crate contains the core crossword-solving code used in the Ingrid
construction app, as well as a standalone binary that can be used to solve
grids from the command line.

### Usage

After [setting up Rust](https://rustup.rs), you can install the Ingrid Core CLI
tool from crates.io:
```
$ cargo install ingrid_core
```

Or install it locally from within this repository:
```
$ cargo install --path .
```

Alternatively, you can run the binary directly from the repository in release mode (highly recommended for performance) using `cargo run --release --`:
```
$ cargo run --release -- examples/example_grid.txt
# Or for batch mode:
$ cargo run --release -- -b examples/batch_slots.txt
```

Then you just need to provide a grid as an input file:

```
$ cat examples/example_grid.txt
....#.....#....
....#.....#....
...............
......##.......
###.....#......
............###
.....#.....#...

You can also use a custom word list (the default is [Spread the
Wordlist](https://www.spreadthewordlist.com)) or customize various other
options.

### Batch Mode (Custom / Non-planar topologies)

For custom, non-planar, or hexagonal slots, you can run the solver in batch mode using the `-b` (or `--batch`) flag. It expects a file containing cell-name slots delimited by spaces and semicolons:
```
$ cat examples/batch_slots.txt
a b c d ;
d c b a ;

$ ingrid_core -b examples/batch_slots.txt
Slot 1: time
Slot 2: emit
```

```
$ ingrid_core --help

Usage: ingrid_core [OPTIONS] [GRID_PATH]

Arguments:
  [GRID_PATH]  Path to the grid file, as ASCII with # representing blocks and . representing empty squares

Options:
  -b, --batch <BATCH>
          Path to a file containing custom slots in batch mode
      --wordlist <WORDLIST>
          Path to a scored wordlist file [default: (embedded copy of Spread the Wordlist)]
      --min-score <MIN_SCORE>
          Minimum allowable word score [default: 50]
      --max-shared-substring <MAX_SHARED_SUBSTRING>
          Maximum shared substring length between entries [default: none]
  -h, --help
          Print help information
  -V, --version
          Print version information
```

### Acknowledgments

* The backtracking search implementation in this library owes a lot to
  "Adaptive Strategies for Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems" by
  Thanasis Balafoutis, which was helpful both as an overview of the CSP space
  and a source of specific implementation ideas.

* The CLI tool includes a copy of the free [Spread the
  Wordlist](https://www.spreadthewordlist.com) dictionary published by Brooke
  Husic and Enrique Henestroza Anguiano.
